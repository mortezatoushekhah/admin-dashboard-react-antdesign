In this repository, I present a dynamic React Dashboard that leverages the powerful Ant Design UI Components library. The aim of this project is to provide an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for displaying key statistics, charts, and tables in a dashboard format.

By utilizing Ant Design's versatile sidebar, I have created a seamless navigation experience, allowing users to effortlessly access different sections of the dashboard. The integration of Antd Tables, combined with the utilization of a fake API provided by https://dummyjson.com/, ensures that the dashboard remains up-to-date with realistic data.

This project encompasses various essential components such as headers, footers, and simple notification panels, providing a comprehensive and well-rounded dashboard solution. Through meticulous development, I have strived to deliver an engaging user experience while maintaining the utmost simplicity and clarity.

Feel free to explore this project, delve into the codebase, and witness the power of React and Ant Design as they come together to create a visually stunning and highly functional dashboard.
